# Morse-Code-Generator
Morse Code Generator - Arduino project. Translates button input to Morse code &amp; displays via LCD. Ideal for learning microcontroller programming &amp; electronics. Code, circuit diagrams &amp; instructions available on GitHub for easy replication/customization."

Project Brief Summery

The project generate Morse Code, It takes serial input from the user and converts it to Morse code.
In Morse Code, each letter has predefined dots and dashes. We provide the input as letters and the output comes in the form of dots and dash beep sounds, using a buzzer and lcd screen deliver the message.
The loop traverses the entered sentence character by character and the switch statement contains the notation.

Although Morse code is not used as much as the past anymore, it still has its own applications like :-
• Popular among enthusiasts in the field of amateur radios. 
• It is also used in aeronautical navigation systems. 
• It is used in ships, Morse code to send light for communication and help. 
• For instance the word SOS, the worldwide standard for requesting help was Morse code.
